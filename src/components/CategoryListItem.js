      <p>
        From CAD to prototyping, fabrication, and assembly. Iâ€™ve designed
        mechanical hardware from internet-connected desktop devices to huge,
        complex motion-controlled systems. I understand how to design for all
        sorts of manufacturing processes and can speak the language to ensure
        that parts get fabricated efficiently and properly.
