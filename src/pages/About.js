            <h2>HI. I'M KENNETH</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a multidisciplinary software and hardware engineer with an MS
              in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech and experience in
              product & experience design, web development, robotics, and
              electronics. For the past 9 years I've built a bunch of crazy and
              creative projects that lie at the intersection of physical and
              digital, including jellyfish robots, internet-of-things devices,
              huge experiential campaigns, and highly complex moving models of
              the solar system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though I'm a mechanical engineer by trade, I have tons of
              experience with electronics and code too. Having a
              multidisciplinary skillset allows me to bridge gaps in diverse
              teams and brings a strong sense of coherence to my work.

            I know this might sound like a lot! But Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough
            to work on incredibly diverse projects that have required some or
            all of these disciplines. I consider myself a lifelong learner, and
            am constantly updating and refining my skillset through my work and
            side projects. Not to mention I also love what I do!
